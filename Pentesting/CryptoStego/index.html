         <h2 class="project-title" align=center>Cryptography & Steganography</h2>
         <p class="project-description">Cryptography and steganography are two essential fields of study that play a crucial role in today's digital age, and their relevance is expected to continue growing in the future.</p>
         <p>Cryptography, the science of secure communication, is vital in protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or tampering. In today's interconnected world, where data breaches and cyber threats are prevalent, cryptography is integral to safeguarding digital transactions, confidential communications, and sensitive data storage. It ensures the privacy, integrity, and authenticity of information, making it indispensable for industries such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and government sectors. As technology advances, the need for robust encryption algorithms and protocols will only increase, as cyber threats become more sophisticated.</p>
         <p>Steganography, on the other hand, is the art of hiding information within other forms of data, such as images, audio, or video. It offers an additional layer of security by concealing the existence of hidden messages. Steganography has various applications, ranging from covert communication and watermarking to digital rights management and anti-counterfeiting measures. As digital media continues to proliferate, steganography can help protect intellectual property, prevent data leaks, and enhance security in multimedia applications. Its relevance is expected to rise as data privacy concerns escalate and novel ways of concealing information are explored.</p>
         <p>In the future, both cryptography and steganography will remain vital as technology advances and new challenges emerge. The rise of quantum computing, for example, poses both opportunities and threats to cryptography. While quantum computing promises advancements in solving complex problems, it also has the potential to break certain encryption algorithms. Therefore, the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques becomes essential to ensure secure communications in the future.</p>
         <p>Moreover, as data privacy becomes a paramount concern and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are enforced, cryptography will play a significant role in compliance and data protection. Additionally, with the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the increasing connectivity of everyday objects, cryptography and steganography will be critical in securing IoT networks and safeguarding sensitive data exchanged between devices.</p>
         <p>In summary, cryptography and steganography are highly relevant in today's digital landscape, protecting data and ensuring secure communication. As technology advances and new challenges arise, both fields will continue to evolve and play a vital role in preserving privacy, securing transactions, and mitigating risks in the future.</p>
